                    stealing from another person are crimes in most countries. Also, it can be a crime to have or sell

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">About</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state
                or other authority.[1] The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally
                accepted definition,[2] though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.[3] The
                most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if
                declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.[2] One proposed definition is that a crime or
                offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community,
                society, or the state ("a public wrong"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.[1][4]

                The notion that acts such as murder, rape, and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.[5] What
                precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue
                of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.

                The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In
                modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty,
                an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the
                nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions,
                execution.

                Usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" (actus reus) must – with
                certain exceptions – be accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" (mens rea).[4]

                While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of
                private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be
                enforced through civil procedure. The world of crime and criminals is often called "the underworld </p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Overview</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">When informal relationships prove insufficient to establish and maintain
                a desired social order, a government or a state may impose more formalized or stricter systems of social
                control. With institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the state can compel
                populations to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform.

                Authorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviors in
                general. Governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and
                visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices that
                legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or preventing crime. In
                addition, authorities provide remedies and sanctions, and collectively these constitute a criminal
                justice system. Legal sanctions vary widely in their severity; they may include (for example)
                incarceration of temporary character aimed at reforming the convict. Some jurisdictions have penal codes
                written to inflict permanent harsh punishments: legal mutilation, capital punishment, or life without
                parole.

                Usually, a natural person perpetrates a crime, but legal persons may also commit crimes. Historically,
                several premodern societies believed that non-human animals were capable of committing crimes, and
                prosecuted and punished them accordingly.[7]

                The sociologist Richard Quinney has written about the relationship between society and crime. When
                Quinney states "crime is a social phenomenon" he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how
                populations perceive it, based on societal norms.
